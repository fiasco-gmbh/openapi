# Photo Requirements

This document was last updated on September 1st, 2023.

For our services to work reliably we require the photos you send us to meet or exceed certain
criteria. The following list shows our basic rule set for photos:

  - Photos must depict normal passenger cars as defined by regulation (EU) 2018/858, more specifically:
    - Classes `M1` and `M1G` without platform types of `SA`, `SB`, `SC`, `SD`, `SG`, and `SH`.
    - Class `N1` without the platform types of `BA`, `BC`, `BD`, `BE`, `SB`, `SG`, `SM`, `SF`, `BCSL`, and `BX`.
    - Cars must be younger than 20 years.
  - Photos have to be pre-classified using the subject field to discern between photos showing
    actual damage and other photos (e.g. general photos of the car or paperwork).
  - The subject of the photos has to be clean (not wet, dirty, glossy, or snowed over) and the car and damages have to
    be clearly visible.
  - Reflections must be kept to a minimum.
  - The car must not be constricted. We recommend at least 3m of free distance around the car.
  - There have to be multiple (ideally four) photos for each damage, taken from different angles
    (slightly tilted left/right/up/down).
  - The resolution of each photo has to be at least be 1500px × 1500px.
  - Photos have to be oriented in the correct way or include EXIF data to correctly determine the orientation.
  - A damaged part must be completely visible on at least one photo.
  - Photos have to be taken using daylight or in a well-lit area. Do not focus light directly on a damaged
    area to avoid reflections and overexposure.
  - Photos must not be manually edited. Markings like lines, arrows, circles, etc. must not be added.
  - Photos must not contain hands / fingers to show or highlight something.
  - Photos must not contain deflectometry patterns (horizontal or vertical stripes).
  - Photos must not contain hail damage.
  - Re-encoding files (e.g. JPEG to JPEG or JPEG to PNG) has to be avoided.
  - Quality settings of file encoders (e.g. JPEG or PNG export) have to be set to 90% or higher.
