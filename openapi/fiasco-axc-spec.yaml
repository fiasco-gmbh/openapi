    We are providing several API endpoints for external partners which are described in this documentation.
    All endpoints are using a REST-like interface, meaning they are called via HTTP with a specific payload
    (described separately for each endpoint, don't forget to set the Content-Type header accordingly) and
    respond with an application/json payload.
